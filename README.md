A basic implementation of a priority based ticket handling system implemented using priority queues on a singly linked list. Features a menu, the user can get a ticket, delete a ticket, process booking and modify any purchased ticket. Different functions have been made to cater to the above. All ticket/booking logs are dumped to a log file to keep track along with the time, date and day of the ticket purchase.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how advanced ticket booking apps for the top airlines around the world are using these data structures to run their ticket booking services. This is a beginner project made by a student new to data structures. 

Future works: Will add a GUI in Tkinter.
